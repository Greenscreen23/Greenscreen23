## Hi there 👋

I'm Lukas and I'm interested in research, computer networks and data systems.

- I'm currently a developer of the Hyrise in-memory database. I've done / am doing:
  - Profile guided optimizations (PGO) and the binary optimization and layout tool (BOLT)
  - More parallelism in the hash join, increasing throughput in industry benchmarks (TPCH) by up to 30%
  - Reduce translation lookaside buffer (TLB) pressure in the radix partitioning
- I've written a [paper on TCP Prague](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3744200.3744770) and [presented it at ANRW'25](https://meetecho-player.ietf.org/playout/?session=IETF123-ANRW-20250722-1230&t=3835)
  - Reproduced an issue with Prague's fallback to classic mode present in a previous paper
  - Measured kernel variables using eBPF to uncover the underlying issue
  - Evaluated Prague with the fallback patched in Mininet and open-sourced the experiment code
- I worked on Containernet (a fork of Mininet)
  - Incorporated multiple research prototypes into the main codebase
  - Evaluated federated learning of TinyML models in Containernet
- I participated in the ICPC world finals with two other HPI students as "Seems to be O(k!)"
- I help organize HPI camps for high school students, e.g. training camps for the federal competition in computer science (Bundeswettbewerb Informatik).
